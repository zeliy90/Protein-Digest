# Protein-Digest
allows the user to see what their peptide will look like after it has been cut up by the peptide chosen. 
Also prints their molecular weight, this program is designed to be used with the website I created with turbo gears.
The program has parameters that are for the website that allows you to pick the length of the digested protein, its max and min weight, and it position.
Im still trying to shorten the program because its a bit to long so Im not completley done with it.
